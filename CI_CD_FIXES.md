# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing .env File Error
**Problem**: Symfony was trying to load `.env` file that didn't exist in CI environment
```
PHP Fatal error: Unable to read the "/home/runner/work/TrevelProject-Backend/TrevelProject-Backend/.env" environment file
```

**Solution**: 
- Create a basic `.env` file in each job before running composer scripts
- Use `--no-scripts` flag during composer install to prevent auto-scripts from running before .env is ready
- Manually run auto-scripts after .env file is created

### 2. Working Directory Issues
**Problem**: GitHub Actions was running in root directory instead of Backend directory
**Solution**: Added `defaults.run.working-directory: ./Backend` to all jobs

### 3. PSR-4 Autoloading Warning
**Problem**: 
```
Class App\Command\CreateAdminCommand located in ./src/command/CreateAdminCommand.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard
```

**Solution**: 
- Added `composer dump-autoload --optimize` after composer install
- This regenerates the autoloader with proper case sensitivity

### 4. Cache Issues in Production Build
**Problem**: Cache operations failing due to missing .env file
**Solution**: 
- Removed problematic cache operations that require full Symfony bootstrap
- Created cache directories manually with proper permissions
- Let Docker handle cache warming during container startup

## Updated Workflow Structure

### Job 1: Test
- ✅ Runs in `./Backend` directory
- ✅ Creates basic .env before composer install
- ✅ Installs dependencies without scripts
- ✅ Fixes autoloader
- ✅ Runs auto-scripts safely
- ✅ Creates test database and runs migrations
- ✅ Runs PHPUnit tests

### Job 2: Security Check  
- ✅ Runs in `./Backend` directory
- ✅ Creates basic .env before composer install
- ✅ Installs production dependencies without scripts
- ✅ Fixes autoloader
- ✅ Runs security audit

### Job 3: Build and Deploy
- ✅ Runs in `./Backend` directory  
- ✅ Installs production dependencies without scripts
- ✅ Fixes autoloader
- ✅ Creates production .env from secrets
- ✅ Prepares cache directories
- ✅ Builds and pushes Docker image

## Key Changes Made

1. **Added working directory defaults** to all jobs
2. **Created .env files** before composer operations
3. **Used `--no-scripts` flag** during composer install
4. **Added autoloader regeneration** with `composer dump-autoload --optimize`
5. **Removed problematic cache operations** that require full Symfony bootstrap
6. **Fixed cache path** in composer dependency caching to `Backend/composer.lock`
7. **Created cache directories manually** instead of using Symfony console commands

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the pipeline should:
- ✅ Install dependencies without errors
- ✅ Run tests successfully 
- ✅ Complete security checks
- ✅ Build Docker images properly
- ✅ Deploy to production (when secrets are configured)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the pipeline** by pushing to a branch
2. **Configure GitHub secrets** as documented in CI_CD_SETUP.md
3. **Monitor the first successful run** and adjust if needed
4. **Add deployment targets** when ready for production deployment
